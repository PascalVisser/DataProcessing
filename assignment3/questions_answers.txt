Review https://github.com/veerdonk/data_processing/blob/master/Snakefile

Answer the following questions:

1. How is the input output construction handled in case of a database?
2. How is de Snakefile documented?
3. What would you improve in this script?

Answers:

1. With the createBlastDB rule at line 32
2. All the rules are doucemnted with the message argument
3. Because the snakefile is long and maybe a little bit cluttered, i would suggest to split the file into smaller files and than import these rules. 
Trying to group related rules into one file.
